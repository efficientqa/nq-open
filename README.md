# Data for the NQ-open task.

The original [Natural Questions dataset](https://ai.google.com/research/NaturalQuestions) was introduced by [Kwiatkowski
et.al. 2019](https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/full/10.1162/tacl_a_00276).

The NQ-open variant was introduced by [Lee et.al. 2019](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1612/).

Code that maps from the original Natural Questions dataset to the NQ-open
variant is available [here](https://github.com/google-research/language/blob/master/language/orqa/preprocessing/convert_to_nq_open.py).

The NQ-open automatic evaluation code is available [here](https://github.com/google-research/language/blob/master/language/orqa/evaluation/evaluate_predictions.py).
